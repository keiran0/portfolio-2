Through the whole process, I did projects on a site called FrontEndMentor. The site provides mockup images of a site, and users must code a site that is as close to the original image as possible. Users can receive feedback from other users in the community on the ways they can improve their code. Most of the projects showcased here are the challenges from the aforementioned site. Some of them are 'challenges' provided throughout the courses I took.",
