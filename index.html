      <h3>Intern at GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK)</h3>
      <p class="timeline-job-description">During my internship, I used <span class='highlight'>Microsoft Excel</span> every day. I was introduced to coding in <span class='highlight'>Microsoft VBA</span> by a colleague. I then used it to automate a small portion of my tasks. This was my first introduction to coding. I thought it was fun, and felt encouraged to learn on my own.</p>

      <p class="timeline-job-description">While taking the course, I was working full-time at a laboratory. I was learning <span class='highlight'>Python</span> in my own free time to see if any of the tasks at work could be automated. I eventually found that most of them were, but left before I was able to bring those ideas up. After seeing the automation process replicated at home, I was inspired to continue to learn.</p>

      <h3>*Manufacturing Technologist at Micron Semiconductor</h3>
      <p class="timeline-job-description">While executing my primary job duties, I spotted an area of improvement, where all stakeholders could not see an overview of information unless they manually looked it up with multiple applications, which was extremely time-consuming even for a single datum. The information needed to be viewed multiple times for different tools, multiple times in a day. </p>
      <p class="timeline-job-description">I wrote <span class='highlight'>SQL</span> queries and developed a <span class='highlight'>Tableau</span> dashboard to help solve this problem, fixing issues and upgrading the dashboard with additional features as needed. I wrote <span class='highlight'>Microsoft Excel VBA</span> code to upgrade existing reports and amended/created other <span class='highlight'>SQL</span> queries when requested. </p>
      <p class="timeline-job-description">In my personal time, I learnt front and back-end web development and some web development frameworks and put those skills to work on some projects. Currently, I am learning machine learning in <span class='highlight'>Python</span> using <span class='highlight'>scikit-learn, along with <span class='highlight'>data analysis</span> tools such as <span class='highlight'>Numpy</span>, <span class='highlight'>Pandas</span>, <span class='highlight'>Seaborn</span>, and <span class='highlight'>Matplotlib</span>.</p>

        <h2>Oct 2021 to Aug 2022</h2>
        <h3>Specialist Diploma in Automation and Robotics</h3>
        <p class="timeline-job-description">I learnt about <span class='highlight'>robotic programming</span>, sensors, and assembly of electromechanical systems. More importantly, I learnt about <span class='highlight'>PLC programming</span> with <span class='highlight'>ladder diagram programming</span>, function block diagrams, <span class='highlight'>structured text programming</span>, and instruction lists.</p>
        <p class="timeline-job-description">I had hands-on experience with controlling inputs (examples include sensors and buttons) and outputs (pneumatic actuators, lights, and buzzers). In the course, I also learnt about <span class='highlight'>machine vision</span> and attended labs where we worked with a machine vision program. In addition, the course also covered <span class='highlight'>data communication and networks.</span></p>
